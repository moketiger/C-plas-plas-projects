*C++ Projects* 🚀

This repository showcases my C++ projects focused on security, mathematics, and data management.
These tools demonstrate my ability to work with logic, user input, randomization, JSON persistence, and mathematical computations in an efficient and structured way.

🔐 1. Secure Password Generator

File: Random_password_generator.cpp
Description:
An interactive program that generates a strong password based on user-defined quantities of:

Numbers (e.g. 1–9)

Letters (uppercase A–Z)

Special characters (e.g. !, @, #, …)

✅ Features:

Random character selection from different sets

User decides how many of each type

Final password is shuffled for maximum security

🧰 Key Concepts:
rand(), arrays, strings, std::swap, randomness logic

🧮 2. Scientific Calculator

File: science_calculator.cpp
Description:
A command-line calculator that supports both basic arithmetic and scientific functions.

🧠 Supported operations:

Basic: +, -, *, /

Advanced: ^ (power), sqrt

Trigonometry: sin, cos, tan (in degrees)

✅ Features:

Prompts the user for numbers and operation

Trigonometric input in degrees

Handles multiple inputs in a loop

Detects and blocks division by zero

Stores calculation history in JSON files (questions.json, results.json)

🧰 Key Concepts:
<cmath>, control flow, JSON with nlohmann/json, trigonometric conversions

✏️ 3. Equation Solver

File: equation_solver.cpp
Description:
A console-based tool to solve algebraic equations (linear) with support for brackets and variables.

✅ Features:

Parses user input (e.g. 4x - 2 = 10)

Handles brackets, operations, and variables

Produces simplified solutions for the unknown variable

🧰 Key Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (classes, encapsulation), vectors, parsing strings into tokens, algorithm design

🎓 4. Student Management System

File: student_management.cpp
Description:
A simple management system for handling student information with persistent storage.

✅ Features:

Add new students (first name, last name, age)

Update student details (name, score, age)

View all stored students with their scores and ages

Saves all data to Students.json

🧰 Key Concepts:
OOP (classes, encapsulation), JSON persistence, file I/O, vectors, loops

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++17

Standard Libraries:

<iostream> – console I/O

<vector> – data handling

<string> – string manipulation

<ctime> – randomness

<cmath> – mathematical functions

External Library:

nlohmann/json
 – for JSON data storage

📚 What I Learned

Managing interactive user input

Building flexible CLI tools with multiple features

Working with randomness and security concepts

Applying mathematical and trigonometric logic

Implementing persistence with JSON files

Designing structured programs using OOP principles

💼 About Me

I'm a practical-minded C++ developer who enjoys building tools that solve real problems.
Whether it's generating secure passwords, solving equations, or managing student records, I focus on functionality, structure, and user experience.
