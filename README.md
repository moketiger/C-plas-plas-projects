This repository showcases my C++ mini-projects focused on security, mathematics, and command-line interaction. These tools demonstrate my ability to work with logic, user input, randomization, and mathematical computations in an efficient and structured way.

## 🔐 1. Secure Password Generator

**File:** `password_generator.cpp`  
**Description:**  
An interactive program that generates a strong password based on user-defined quantities of:
- Numbers (e.g. 1-9)
- Letters (uppercase A-Z)
- Special characters (e.g. !, @, #, ...)

✅ **Features:**
- Random character selection from different sets
- User selects how many of each type
- Final password is shuffled for security

🧰 **Key Concepts:**  
`rand()`, arrays, strings, `std::swap`, character logic

## 🧮 2. Scientific Calculator

**File:** `science_calculator.cpp`  
**Description:**  
A command-line calculator that supports both **basic arithmetic** and **scientific functions**.

### 🧠 Supported operations:
- Basic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Advanced: `^` (power), `sqrt`
- Trigonometry: `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (in degrees)

✅ **Features:**
- Prompts the user for numbers and operation
- Trigonometric input in degrees
- Handles multiple inputs in a loop
- Detects and blocks division by zero

🧰 **Key Concepts:**  
`<cmath>`, control flow, I/O, function selection, trigonometric conversions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++17
- **Standard Libraries:**
  - `<iostream>` – console I/O
  - `<ctime>` – random seed
  - `<cmath>` – mathematical functions
  - `<string>` – string manipulation

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Managing interactive user input
- Creating modular logic with loops and conditions
- Building flexible CLI tools with multiple features
- Working with arrays and functions
- Applying randomness securely
